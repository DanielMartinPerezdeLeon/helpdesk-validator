# INSPIRE Validation Community
This space is used for discussions and announcements around INSPIRE validation & conformity testing. Before reporting a problem or making a pull request, please read the [contribution guidelines](contribution_guidelines.md).

Use the [*Issue tracker*](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-validator/issues/new?template=problem.md) to report a problem with the INSPIRE Reference Validator or test results.

Use the [*Discussions tab*](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-validator/discussions/) to start a discussion, raise a question or propose a new feature or an improvement on the INSPIRE Reference Validator, choosing the appropriate category. 

Please follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) anytime when you interact with the INSPIRE community in this space.

The status of the solutions to all the issues currently open in the helpdesk can be checked on the [project board](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-validator/projects/1).

Please note that the helpdesk should not be used to report generic issues with INSPIRE implementation, but only to report problems of the INSPIRE Reference Validator (i.e. tests that are/might not be currently implemented or issues to the web application) and to collect improvement proposals.

Please check the [changelog of the current and past releases](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-validator/releases) and the [release planning strategy](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-validator/tree/master/release%20strategy) for the plan of future releases of the INSPIRE Reference Validator.
