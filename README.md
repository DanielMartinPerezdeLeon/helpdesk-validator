# INSPIRE Validation Community
This space is used for discussions and announcements around INSPIRE validation & conformity testing. Before reporting a problem or making a pull request, please read the [contribution guidelines](contribution_guidelines.md).

Use the issue tracker (helpdesk) to:
- [report a problem](https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/issues/new?template=problem.md) with the INSPIRE validator or test results,
- [propose a new feature or an improvement](https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/issues/new?template=improvement-proposal.md) to the existing functionality of the INSPIRE validator, or
- [start a discussion or raise a question](https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/issues/new?template=discussion.md)  on the INSPIRE validator

The status of the solutions to all the issues currently open in the helpdesk can be checked on the [project board](https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/projects/1).

Please note that the helpdesk should not be used to report generic issues with INSPIRE implementation, but only to report problems of the Validator (i.e. tests that are/might not be currently implemented or issues to the web application) and to collect improvement proposals.

Please check the [changelog of the current and past releases](https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/releases) and the [release planning strategy](https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/tree/master/release%20strategy) for the plan of future releases of the INSPIRE Reference Validator.
